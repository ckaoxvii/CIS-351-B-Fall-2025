## Logical Values (continued)

Internally, R evaluates `TRUE` as the numeric value 1 and `FALSE` as 0.

```{r}
TRUE + 1
```

```{r}
FALSE * 45
```

## `NA` Values

In R, empty entries in a data set are represented by `NA`, a special type of object used to indicate missing values.

```{r}
class(NA)
```

`NA` behaves differently compared to other data types (even `TRUE` and `FALSE`).

```{r}
NA + pi
```

```{r}
11*NA
```

In R, summary statistics cannot be calculated when a data set contains `NA` values. We will revisit this point when we discuss methods for handling and removing `NA`s.
